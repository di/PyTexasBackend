# Grants

Our goal is to ensure that everyone who wants to attend PyTexas can do so,
regardless of age, race, gender, ethnicity, ability or sexual orientation. One
way we make this possible is by providing financial assistance to community
members that are otherwise unable to attend.

In addition to already subsidized rates for individuals, students and those under
the age of eighteen, this can include free or discounted registration fees,
hotels, and travel assistance. These opportunity grants come directly from the
PyTexas budget on a case-by-case basis.

If you are facing financial hardship, or would not be able to attend without
assistance, please email us at
[conference@pytexas.org](mailto:conference@pytexas.org) with details or questions.

If your company is interested in contributing to our grants budget, consider
becoming a [Diversity & Inclusion
Sponsor](/2019/page/sponsors/prospectus#exclusivebenefits).
